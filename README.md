PHY116
========================================================

Jupyter notebooks for the undergraduate astro lab on calculating
orbits, run in the spring semester at Sheffield University. 

These notebooks can be viewed statically online  [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/StuartLittlefair/PHY116/tree/master/).

Alternatively, if you would like to download and run the notebooks
interactively, you can do that. They are intended to be executed
with Jupyter 4 or newer. You can find installation instructions
[here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html).

The notebooks for this course, and  the associated data can be downloaded 
[here](https://github.com/StuartLittlefair/PHY116/zipball/master).
Unzip the notebooks:

```
unzip PHY116.zip
```

and start the Jupyter notebook in the resulting directory.

```
jupyter notebook
```
